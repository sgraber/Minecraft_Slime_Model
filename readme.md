# Minecraft Slime

**I am moving this design off of Thingiverse in protest of their attempt to patent designs originally conceived by the 3D printing community. This file can now be found on Github at **

**For more information, please see the following article: http://www.openbeamusa.com/blog/2014/5/22/stay-classy-makerbot**  

**#makerbot, #takerbot**  

I have uploaded both a DesignSpark Mechanical and STL of the model. In Minecraft, this character is 8 blocks x 8 blocks x 8 blocks. In my model file, I have it set so that 1 block = 10mm. Scale appropriately when printing, otherwise it'll come out rather big.  :P
